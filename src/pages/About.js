      Previously, I've been an intern with CBC where I worked with the interactive team as a developer to build applications and visualizations on the web. I also
      worked with reporters and journalists to gather and clean data.

      <br/>
      For my first internship, I was a JavaScript developer with Flourish (Flourish is a data visualization software for creating interactive visualizations on the web).
      At Flourish I used JavaScript and D3 to build, fix, and improve Flourish templates. I was the lead developer for the Chord Diagram and Parliament chart templates.

      In University I studied journalism at Ryerson University. In 2017 I also graduated from the Lede Program for Data Journalism at Columbia University where I learned Python and PostgreSQL.
